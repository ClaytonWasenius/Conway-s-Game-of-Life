# Conways-Game-of-Life
This is a program that displays Conway's Game of Life. User can activate grid spots, then allow the "game of life" to commence when desired. This 2d process will be further built upon to achieve both 3d and 4d environemnts along with a user ability to manipulate the rules, which John Conway first established in 1970, with the goal to discover an entire variance of ecosystem thriving possabilities and visualize them in 3d, along with perhaps how an ecosystem could multiply within a 4d landscape/universe. 

Please rate, and let me know what you think!
